# YOLO Algorithm Implementation with Keras & Tensorflow 

The project implements Convolutional Deep Neural Network (ConvNet) You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm. It is based on a Keras + TensorFlow trained model.

## Prerequisites

The project requires Keras + TensorFlow. There is also an HTTP Strefaming version that display annotated images in streaming mode. Thus it also requires Flask.

## Installing

Clone the GitHub repository to install the project. It is possible to run the project on RasperryPi also.


## Running the script

### Run in console mode:
python main_cv2_drawing.py

### Run in streaming mode:
python main_flask_server.py
